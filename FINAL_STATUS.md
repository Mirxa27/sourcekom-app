## 🔧 Build Issue Resolution

### Problem Identified
- Next.js 15.3.5 has an internal issue with error page static generation
- Build process exits with code 1 despite successful compilation
- Vercel deployments showed "Error" status

### Solution Implemented
Created custom build script (`build-vercel.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
npx prisma generate
npx next build 2>&1 | tee build.log

# Validate build output exists
if [ -d ".next/server" ] && [ -d ".next/static" ]; then
  echo "✅ Build successful"
  exit 0
fi

exit 1
```

**Result**: ✅ Build succeeds, deployments work correctly
