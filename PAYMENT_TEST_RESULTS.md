## 🔄 Next Steps for Full Testing

### 1. Access Admin Panel
```
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/admin/payment-settings
```

### 2. Verify Configuration
- Check all settings are displayed correctly
- API key should be masked (********)
- All webhook events should be checked
- Test mode should be enabled

### 3. Test Direct Payment
Use the provided test card:
```
Card Number: 5123450000000008
Card Holder: Test User
Expiry: 12/25
CVV: 100
```

### 4. Test Saved Methods
After successful payment with "Save Card" option:

- Country: Saudi Arabia (SAU)
- Test Mode: Enabled
- Webhook: Enabled with endpoint
- Secret Key: Generated (128 chars)
- All 7 webhook events: Enabled

## 💡 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Log in as admin
2. Visit `/dashboard/admin/payment-settings`
3. Verify all fields are populated correctly
4. Try modifying settings and saving
5. Test payment initiation endpoint
6. Test direct payment with test card
7. Verify saved payment methods

### Automated Testing
Run Playwright tests:
```bash
npm run test:payment
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **MyFatoorah Demo Account**: Using demo API key for testing
2. **Test Cards**: Use provided test cards for successful/failed scenarios
3. **Webhook Endpoint**: Must be publicly accessible for production
4. **Security**: Never commit real API keys to version control
5. **Production**: Switch to production mode and real API key before going live
